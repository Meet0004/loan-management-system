# Loan Management System

## Overview
I'm excited to share my first full-stack project â€“ a **Loan Management System**. This project provides essential features for managing multiple loans, user authentication, and EMI calculations.

This system is designed as a **fully custom-built module** for use in **supermarket simulator games or town/city simulator games**. Every aspect, from the visual color palette to the intricate database management, has been independently developed.

## Key Features

-  **User Database** â€“ Secure storage and retrieval of user data.
-  **Password Authentication** â€“ Ensures security and access control.
-  **EMI Calculator** â€“ Calculates EMIs dynamically.
-  **Custom-Built Module** â€“ Designed for finance management in simulator games.
-  **1500+ Lines of JavaScript Code** â€“ Powers interactive features.
-  **Original & Unique** â€“ Developed from scratch with no prior replication.
-  **Robust Backend** â€“ Efficiently manages game data.

## Use Cases
-  **Finance module for simulator games** (e.g., supermarket simulator, town/city simulator).
-  **Loan management applications** for game-based economy systems.
