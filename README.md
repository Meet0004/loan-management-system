# Loan Management System

## Overview
I'm excited to share my first full-stack project â€“ a **Loan Management System**. This project provides essential features for managing multiple loans, user authentication, and EMI calculations.

This system is designed as a **fully custom-built module** for use in **supermarket simulator games or town/city simulator games**. Every aspect, from the visual color palette to the intricate database management, has been independently developed.

## Key Features
-  **Multiple Loans** â€“ Manage multiple loans efficiently.
-  **User Database** â€“ Secure storage and retrieval of user data.
-  **Password Authentication** â€“ Ensures security and access control.
-  **EMI Calculator** â€“ Calculates EMIs dynamically.
-  **Custom-Built Module** â€“ Designed for finance management in simulator games.
-  **1500+ Lines of JavaScript Code** â€“ Powers interactive features.
-  **Original & Unique** â€“ Developed from scratch with no prior replication.
-  **Robust Backend** â€“ Efficiently manages game data.

## Use Cases
-  **Finance module for simulator games** (e.g., supermarket simulator, town/city simulator).
-  **Loan management applications** for game-based economy systems.

## Tech Stack
### Frontend:
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript**

### Backend:
- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **ECMAScript Modules (ECMAS)**

### Database:
- **MongoDB**

## Collaboration
I'm open to collaborating on projects that focus on **building and learning together**! If you're interested, feel free to connect with me.

## Future enhancements - 
- **Password Recovery using email**
- **Late Payment Fees in case the daily payment is not paid**
- **Use of API as of now everything works on local host only**
- **Loan repayment trackig**
- **TypeScript/GraphQL integration**
